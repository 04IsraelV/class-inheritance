# class-inheritance
The repository provides a collection of code snippets demonstrating various concepts and applications of class inheritance
in the C++ programming language. Class inheritance is a fundamental principle in object-oriented programming that facilitates
code reuse and the creation of class hierarchies.
  Repository Content:
    Basic Examples: 
      Offers straightforward implementations of class inheritance, highlighting the relationship between a base class
      and its derived classes.
    Multiple Inheritance:
      Explores situations where a class can inherit attributes and behaviors from multiple base classes,
      demonstrating how to manage potential conflicts and ambiguities.
    OOP in C++: 
      Illustrates working with constructors and destructors in inheritance contexts, ensuring proper resource management.
    Advanced Inheritance Concepts: 
      Demonstrates working with class inheritance in a slightly more detailed manner, involving private
      attributes for manipulation.
    Inheritance in Different Files: Presents a practical example of organizing code with diverse classes in different files to enhance
      work on extensive projects.
  Repository Objective:
    This project aims to provide a resource for those looking to understand and apply class inheritance in C++. Each example is clearly
    and concisely documented to facilitate comprehensive comprehension.
